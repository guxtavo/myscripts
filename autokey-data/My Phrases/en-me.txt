Hello:

Thank you for raising management attention to this case.  My name is
Katerina Hamplova and I am the Team Lead for Red Hat's Global Support

Unfortunately you updated the ticket at 17.29, when the support centre
was already closed. Lee will be in the office around 9.00 a.m. BST so
please allow me some time to give him a heads up and let him find a
moment to call you. With your permission I am removing the management
escalation on this particular case.  I apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused.

Thank you for bringing attention to this case.  My name is Kent Lamb, and I am a supervisor at Red Hat.  We will be re-assigning this case to our EMEA office so that you can work with an engineer in your daytime.  We apologise for any inconvenience you have had.


Dear Customer,
I am Katerina Hamplova and I am Team Lead in the EMEA Technical Support Team. This case has been brought to my attention thanks to your management escalation.
I've been looking into the case and I'm sorry to inform you that your account is entitled to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation, which is self-supported. We still provide support for RHN related issues (problem with registering the machine) but nothing more for this kind of subscription.
Your subscription however entitles you to access to your knowledge base that you can visit to trouble shoot the issue: https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/
Regarding the availability and versions of software in our channels, please note that Red Hat has a different approach to updates, if compared to other competitors, as we want to make sure we release stable and tested software.
If you feel that your business or product needs require a different level of support or technology, I would suggest you contact our Sales department to check whether this is the best solution for you. I understand that Nicole Franke (nfranke@redhat.com) is allocated to your account as your direct Sales representative.
I'm going to put this ticket on a Pending Closure state, which means this is going to be closed in a 7 days time.
If you feel like asking further questions, please update this ticket before that time, so it will not be closed.
Thank you for your understanding.

Kind Regards,
Katerina
