Hi,

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULY. 

Understood. If I may suggest, please trigger SysRq+c next time to crash the system manually in order to generate a vmcore. Only with the vmcore (in rare occasions not even with that) we can explain why the server was behaving like that.

In case the server doesn't keep crashing all the times, i.e., this is an isolate event, would you accept lowering the severity from Urgent to High? 

If this is an isolate event and according to our severity level definition, the case severity should be High, or even Normal if you want an RCA (root cause analysis).

> could you provide us other reasons for this unresponsive issue 

Do not discard hardware fault. The Kernel is interacting with the hardware all the time. We have some knowledge base articles that will help us identifying on the spot when we need to advise you to seek for your hardware vendor.

Could you please check whether ASR is enabled or not and also check the ILO logs:
