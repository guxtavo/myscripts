Hi,

Thank you for raising management attention to this case. My name is Gustavo Figueira and I am a team lead within the Global Support Services Team in EMEA.

Unfortunately you updated the ticket at 17.29, when the support centre was already closed. Lee will be in the office around 9.00 a.m. BST so please allow me some time to give him a heads up and let him find a
moment to call you. With your permission I am removing the management escalation on this particular case.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

In the meantime, information regarding severity levels and response times is always available at

Thank you for your patience and kind regards,

Gustavo Figueira
