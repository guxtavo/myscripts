Hi,

Thank you for raising management attention to this case. My name is Gustavo Figueira and I am a team lead within the Global Support Services Team in EMEA.

Please understand that in occasions finding a solution to an issue may take some time since the analysis of the information, tests, and errors is not always simple, and we may need to involve other engineers to collaborate. My colleague Petr is actively working in collaboration with senior engineers now to try to find a solution to your problem.

If you still require a manager to get involved in this case, please do not hesitate to get in touch with myself, a manager or a technician on the following numbers using this link below-

Please let me know if we can be of any more help. Thank you for your patience and kind regards,

Gustavo Figueira
