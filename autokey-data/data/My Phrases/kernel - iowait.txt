Hello,

Thank you for contacting Red Hat Global Support Services. My name is Gustavo and I will be handling your case. 

In order to have a better understanding about your question/issue I kindly ask you to generate a sosreport from the affected system and upload it to your case. You can find instructions about creating the sosreport at this article: 

What is a "sosreport" and how do I create it in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and later?

> The Average I/O wait for this servers contantly more than 10.00.

The iowait is the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request. It can mean that your IO devices are not fast enough to respond to the workload you are putting on them. With the sosreport I will try to understand whether this is the case or not.

If you have further question do not hesitate to contact us.
