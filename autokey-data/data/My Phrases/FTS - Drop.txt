Hello,

As we have not received any update on this case for over 12 hours, we are no longer monitoring this case 24x7.

I tried calling you back at +?????? (your contact number on the Customer Portal) before dropping the 24x7 support without success.

You are still able to receive Premium Severity 1/2 support on this issue at any time, however you will need to call in for this to occur.

Free call numbers are available on our Customer Portal at: https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/technicalSupport.html
