Hello,

Thank you for contacting Red Hat Global Support Services. My name is Gustavo and I will be handling your case. 

In order to have a better understanding about your question/issue I kindly ask you to generate a sosreport from the affected system and upload it to your case. You can find instructions about creating the sosreport at this article: 

What is a "sosreport" and how do I create it in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6 and later?

Also could you please tell whether kdump is configured on this system or not? If it is and if a vmcore file was generate, then please upload it to your case. Normally the vmcores are dumped in /var/crash. But that depends on your kdump configuration.
