> After upgrade the kernel, we are getting kernel panic error

My priority is to get your server up and running. For that I will ask you to try to boot[1] an old kernel to get your system back online. You can do this by selecting an older version in the Grub menu, right after the machine's POST.

When you already have your server back online, for RCA (root cause analysis) purposes, Red Hat will need the following:

  * Do backup of the new kernel's initrd 
  * Regenerate[2] the new kernel's initrd (as .bkp)
  * Do a tarball from the /boot directory and upload to the case
  * Upload a fresh sosreport[3]

In case the server cannot boot any of the older kernels, please provide the following:

  * Screenshot of the error
  * Fresh sosreport[3] regenated in rescue[4] mode

Please understand that some problems might be more complicate than they look. That's why I need insight of your system before we can do something. I don't want to hurry to fix your system and end up making it worse. Besides, if I end up needing to do something, I will need to get the data anyway.

Working over console can be time consuming, so in order to save time, please consider generating the sosreport.

> Error screen shot has been attached. please check the same. 

The error message which calls my attention is:

  Volume group "VolGroup00" not found

There are several reasons this can happen.

> we already tried to boot with old kernel. 

Did you try all the available kernels and none of them work? If this is the case, it might mean something external to the OS can be causing this. The boot code, kernel image and initrd are present and can be read, but when the system tries to activate the root volume group, the system is not able to find it. Do you have your rootvg over SAN?

> still getting same kernel panic error. please took remote session and check.

After you boot with the installation media into the rescue[1] mode and successfully executed "chroot /mnt/sysimage", let me know and I will share the remote session information with you.
