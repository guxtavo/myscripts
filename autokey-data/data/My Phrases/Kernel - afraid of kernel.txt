RHEL 6.6 is GA, and you can find kernel 2.6.32-504 available for updating which includes the fix in the Bugzilla.

I see you feel uncertain of updating the kernel in 60 servers and that you also have a long update queue. You also are interested in a fix without to have to upgrade.

Updating a RHEL Kernel is almost not harmless at all. It is a very common and tested procedure by our QE team. It is also very easy to "rollback" in case the new kernel doesn't boot. You simply boot with the old kernel.

Within the same major version, we maintain the API and the ABI unchanged, which allow the applications to run unaltered. 

You can even have a short maintenance window, as you just need to reboot the servers to run the new kernel, as the installation can be done before the maintenance window, or in a low traffic window. 

The fix is provided in the new Kernel. If you have questions about upgrading the Kernel let me know.
