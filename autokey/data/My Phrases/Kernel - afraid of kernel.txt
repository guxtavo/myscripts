I understand you feel uncertain about updating the kernel and the time needed for that.

Updating a RHEL Kernel is almost not harmless at all. It is a very common and tested procedure by our QE team. It is also very easy to "rollback" in case the new kernel doesn't boot. You simply boot[1] with the old kernel.

If your new kernel doesn't boot, the first thing you should try is to boot back[1] the old kernel and try to regenerate[2] new kernel'sinitrd.

Within the same major version, we maintain[3] the API and the ABI unchanged, which allow the applications to run unaltered.

In order to simplify the Kernel update process, it is recommended to update the package (yum update kernel) before the maintenance window, or in a low traffic window first. This operation will cause minimum load and should be performed before to save time.

To boot the new kernel, you can have a short maintenance window, as you just need to reboot the servers to run the new kernel.

The fix is provided in the new Kernel. If you have questions about upgrading the Kernel let me know.
