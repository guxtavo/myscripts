I understand you problem is:

  - After upgrading from _ to _ (yum update), any kernel (both old and new) panics after booting

If it is possible to restore (from backup, snapshot, etc) the system easily, please do, as we might need some time to troubleshoot this issue.

I cannot tell what are your high availability goals, but for issues like this, sometimes we need to make several boots in order to find the root cause.

It would help us if you could make a clone/snapshot/backup of your system. We can use this "cloned" vm to  do the troubleshooting without impacting your production.

I will need your help you troubleshoot this issue:

  - Upload sosrepor (from rescue mode)[4] of the affected system
  - Upload /boot content

The error message you have shows that the root vg was not found. This can happen when you upgrade the kernel. The odd part is that when you upgrade a kernel, the old kernel has no change, thus it should boot normally. 

  - Do you see the same error with both old and new kernel?

If you are running vmwaretools, could you please check whether you have the latest version, just to be safe?

> After upgrade the kernel, we are getting kernel panic error

My priority is to get your server up and running. For that I will ask you to try to boot[1] an old kernel to get your system back online. You can do this by selecting an older version in the Grub menu, right after the machine's POST.

When you already have your server back online, for RCA (root cause analysis) purposes, Red Hat will need the following:

  * Do backup of the new kernel's initrd 
  * Regenerate[2] the new kernel's initrd 
  * Do a tarball from the /boot directory and upload to the case
  * Upload a fresh sosreport[3]

In case the server cannot boot any of the older kernels, please provide the following:

  * Screenshot of the error (preferrably after booting without "rhgb and quiet" in the cmline
  * Fresh sosreport[3] regenated in rescue[4] mode

Please understand that some problems might be more complicate than they look. That's why I need insight of your system before we can do something. I don't want to hurry to fix your system and end up making it worse. Besides, if I end up needing to do something, I will need to get the data anyway.

Working over console can be time consuming, so in order to save time, please consider generating the sosreport.

The error message which calls my attention is:

  Volume group "VolGroup00" not found

There are several reasons this can happen. Did you try all the available kernels and none of them work? If this is the case, it might mean something external to the OS can be causing this. The boot code, kernel image and initrd are present and can be read, but when the system tries to activate the root volume group, the system is not able to find it. Do you have your rootvg over SAN?

After you boot with the installation media into the rescue[1] mode and successfully executed "chroot /mnt/sysimage", let me know and I will share the remote session information with you.
