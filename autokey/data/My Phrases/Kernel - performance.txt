Before we start, there is a nice presentation regarding performance tuning on RHEL6 and RHEL7 that you might use to do a checklist:

  Performance Tuning and Analysis of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7

There are some questions we need to clarify before we proceed with the troubleshooting:

  1) How are you measuring the performance? What are the indicators you use to say the performance is bad or good?
  
  2) Can you reproduce the degradation at will? Is there a particular time frame the issue is manifested?

  3) Since when the performance impact was noticed? 

  4) Where there any recent changes to your system? New application deployment? 

Have you checked what c-states your system is running the most?

Did you try using tuned?

Did you try to set the c-states manually at boot time?
